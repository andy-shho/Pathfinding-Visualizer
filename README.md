Pathfinding Visualizer
=================================
A Project to Better Understand Data Structure and Algorithms

Overview:
---------
The Pathfinding Visualizer is an application that visually demonstrates Dijkstra's Algorithm using nodes and walls. The application includes a resizable grid, a start and finish node selector, and a reset function. I plan on adding different algorithms to this application in the future.
